## Major/New Features

### Rails 5 support

`Spree 3.2` is now compatible with `Rails 5` compared to `3.1` which used to run on `Rails 4.2`.
Thanks to that you can start using all of the [new great features available in Rails 5](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/5_0_release_notes.html)

### Products Tagging

You can now tag Products additionally to just using Taxons. Tagging module uses `acts-as-taggable-on` gem. You can easily fetch a list of Products associated to any given tag(s) which should be very helpful for creating new dynamic products listings.
