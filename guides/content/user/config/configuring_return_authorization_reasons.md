title: Return Authorization Reasons
---

## Introduction

Before you make any Return you have to describe reasons, why the user wants to return the items. This is place where you can create Reasons and describe them with just a name.

![Return Autho Reasons]()

Press button in right upper corner *New RMA Reason*.

![New RMA Reason]()

Input name that will be present during Return process and click *Create* button. It is not necessary to activate Reason instantly. You can choose when you want to make a Return Reason active. For example you might want to create a Holiday refund reason - the user ordered something during holiday but wants to return it when you already deactived this certain reason.

Thats all, you have a reason to make refunds to the Users !
