## Searching Products

When you click the **Products** tab, you will see dropdown with the **Products settings** on the Admin Interface. In the next step click **Products** tab in the **Products settings**. Now you are presented with a summary of all actual products in the shop.

Next to each product there are 3 buttons. 

* **Edit** - Allows you to make [additional edition in the product](editing_products.md).
* **Clone** - Allows you to make a [duplicate of the certain product](cloning_products.md).
* **Delete** - Allows you to [delete certain product](deleting_products.md).
